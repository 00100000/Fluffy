- automatically update mute role overwrites when a new channel is made
- every 24 hours, check if mute role overwrites are properly set up on all servers. If they aren't, set them up automatically
- track punishments (with database)
- ?slowmode <time>
- if only an integer is given as the duration of a punishment, automatically assume it's in minutes. Also, switch from ms to our own millisecond parser (probably a parseMs() function in parse.js)
- allow server owners to bypass having to have a higher role than the user they are using a command on
- ?setup - guides the user through setting up Fluffy's logs in their server with messageCollectors
- switch to mongodb for storing data
- make error messages in commands more consistent and use the ErrorCross emoji (maybe make a util to handle them)
- make messageDelete and messageUpdate track what channel a message was deleted in
- ?userinfo
- ?serverinfo
- switch parse commands to built in regex
- add per-server prefixes
