- ?userinfo
- ?serverinfo
- switch parse commands to built in regex
- allow server owners to bypass having to have a higher role than the user they are using a command on
- send thank you/help message when Fluffy is added to a server
- switch to mongodb for storing data
- track punishments (with database)
- make Fluffy compatible without admin by making a noBotPerms() method that checks Fluffy's per-channel and per-server perms needed when running a command
- ?setup - guides the user through setting up Fluffy's logs in their server with messageCollectors
- make error messages in commands more consistent and use the ErrorCross emoji (maybe make a util to handle them)
- add per-server prefixes
- automatically update mute role overwrites when a new channel is made
- every 24 hours, check if mute role overwrites are properly set up on all servers. If they aren't, set them up automatically
